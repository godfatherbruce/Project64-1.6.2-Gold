Project64 1.6.2 Gold is a 3rd party deployment-ready dual-core/level Nintendo 64 software emulator developed by Bruce The Godfather Shankle and none else from the source code of Project64 1.6.2 in this fork. This is a divergent fork made with the intent to provide an update for Project64 1.6.2 accoording to my vision. This does not target anywhere near hardware-level accuracy or Public Domain ROMs. Project64 1.6.2 Gold's specialty is with playing non-hardware compatible ROMhacks (typically older one's) and running on low-end Windows computers which lack the necessary specs required for accurate emulation, although this emulator is not capable of accurate emulation. Project64 1.6.2 Gold is really just an emulator that allows flawed rom hacks to be played although not compatible with the real hardware.
